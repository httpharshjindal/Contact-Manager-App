# Contact Manager App

Welcome to the Contact Manager App repository! This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the backend and frontend development. The app allows users to manage contacts just like a typical contact manager, with features for viewing a contact list, adding new contacts, and a dialer functionality for searching and adding new numbers.
